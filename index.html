# Presentation Goal

The goal of this presentation is to serve as a quick start guide to making a package by bring together multiple sources of amazing information and tutorials to show how easy it is to not only create a package, but to integrate automated building, testing, and web documentation by utilizing pre-built R packages. I hope this inspires others to create and contribute to packages that are used daily in R.

## Goals

- General understanding of packages
- Follow methods from Hadley's [*R Packages*][r-pkg-book] book for setting up your envinroment and package creating methods
- Hosting on github
- Automate build testing
- Code coverage
- Generate a package webpage with `pkgdown`
  - Automate `pkgdown` site with **Travis CI**

---

name: prerequisites

# Prerequisites

- It is recommended that you insure R is up to date on your device by downloading the most recent version [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)
- In a new R session install these packages:
``` r
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr"))
# get the development versions from github
devtools::install_github("r-lib/devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-lib/usethis")
```

#### C compiler
- Check if you have by running this in your console:
``` r
devtools::has_devel()
```
  - If `FALSE` is returned, follow section 1.3 in Hadley's book [*R Packages*][r-pkg-getting-started] for assistance in getting everything set up

#### Git
- To host the package you will need Git and GitHub setup with RStudio
  - Follow Chapter 14.2 "Initial set up" of [*R Packages*][git-setup] if you do not have this already
  
---
name: what-is-a-package

# What is a Package?
- Think of a package as a collection of information that makes your life easier
- Packages are often thought of as a collection of functions with help documentation.
- However, packages may also include datasets.
- All of the information in a package once loaded is stored in a nice virtual library, which is why you call: library(package_name). In essence, you are adding the tools to your temporary library.

---

name: create-package

# Creating a Package With **usethis**

``` r
library(usethis)
create_package("~/path/to/directory")
```

.pull-left[
- Choose a file path you want your package to be saved
  - `create_package("~/desktop/samplepackage")` where `samplepackage` is the name of your package
  - The package name should be lowercase and have no spaces, underderscores, or hyphens
- Run the code in the RStudio console
- `create_package` will:
  - Create the directory
  - Create the basic file structure
  - Creates .Rproj file for project work flows
  - Switch your RStudio to the project made for your package
- `.gitignore`: anticipates Git usage and ignores some standard, behind-the-scenes files created by R and RStudio
]

.pull-right[
- `.Rbuildignore`:  lists files that we need to have around but that should not be included when building the R package from source
- `.Rproj.user`: if you have it, is a directory used internally by RStudio
- `DESCRIPTION`: provides [metadata about your package][r-pkg-metadata]
- [`NAMESPACE`][r-pkg-namespace]: declares the functions your package exports for external use and the external functions your package imports from other packages. At the moment, it holds temporary-yet-functional placeholder content
- `R/`: directory is the [‚Äúbusiness end‚Äù of your package][r-pkg-r]. It will soon contain .R files with function definitions.
- `YOURPACKAGE.Rproj`: is the file that makes this directory an RStudio Project
]

---

name: first-function

# First Function

- For this example we will make a simple `is_even()` function for demonstration purposes
- If you have created a package before you may be acustomed to creating a new script, writing the code, and then saving it inside the `R/` directory
- With the package `usethis` we can follow a smoother flow
- Type `use_r("is_even")` into the console
  - This will Create a .R file called `is_even.R` for us inside the `R/` directory
  - `use_r()` Takes care of naming and saving the script into the correct directory for us!
- We will define our function in the .R script that has been made:

```r
is_even &lt;- function(x) {
  x %% 2 == 0
}
```

---

name: test-functions

# Testing Functions Within a Package

- How can we efficiently test our functions for our package?
- Avoid running the function locally, instead we can use `load_all()` to experiment with our new function
  - This will automatically save your .R files if they have not been saved previously, this ensures you are locally testing what you have coded
- Note that `load_all()` has made the `is_even()` function available, although it does not exist in the global workspace
- `load_all()` simulates the process of building, installing, and attaching the foofactors package; this is much faster than building, installing, and attaching the package
- Now we can type `is_even(10)` into our console to test our package
  - We can see our function is from our new package! ü•≥

---

name: check-it

# *check()* it!

- Now that we know our `is_even()` function is working as expected, how can we check if our package as a whole will work?
- `check()` is the gold standard for checking that an R package is in full working order
- Make a habit to run `check()` after each change to *check* if your package is producing any warnings, errors, or notes
- `check()` will produce a lot of out put, generally the part of the output we are interested in will be the ending that displays:

``` r
0 errors ‚úî | 2 warnings ‚úñ | 0 notes ‚úî
```

- If you have been following along your package will have these warnings
- Whenever there is an error, warning, or note, the output above this text will show you why these statuses were generated
  - `Non-standard license specification: What license it uses`
  - `Undocumented code objects: ‚Äòis_even‚Äô`
- These two warnings will be addressed soon
- We have made a lot of progress, next we will edit the `DESCRIPTION` file and push our progress to GitHub

---

name: description

# Editing the **DESCRIPTION** File

- The `DESCRIPTION` file provides metadata about your package
  - For more information look at chapter 5 [metadata about your package][r-pkg-metadata]
- In the `DESCRIPTION` file edit these:
  - Make yourself the author
  - Write some descriptive text in the `Title` and `Description` fields

```
Package: samplepackage
Title: Is That Number Even?
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R:
    person(given = "Kyle",
           family = "Harris",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "koderkow@gmail.com")
Description: There are a few times in ones programming life where one
    needs to find out if a number is truly even. This package unlocks
    the puzzling matter that is even numbers.
License: What license it uses
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
```

---

name: license

# Adding a License

- Hadley provides a fantastic link that summarizes the different kinds of software licenses: [Pick a License, Any License][pick-a-license]
- We will set up a MIT license
  - Simple and permissive license
  - Includes generic legal disclaimer of liability
  - `DESCRIPTION` requires: `License: MIT + file LICENSE`
    - The `+ file LICENSE` also requires an additonal file, `LICENSE`
    - This file generally has `YEAR:` and `COPYRIGHT HOLDER:` fields
- Lucky for us, `usethis` has a function that will set this up for us
- Run `usethis::use_mit_license("FIRST-NAME LAST-NAME")` in the console
- This will create the files for MIT and update your `DESCRIPTION` file for you
- `usethis` will print out to the consoles what it is adding and/or changing to files in your package directory
- This addresses the `Non-standard license specification: What license it uses` warning we received from `check()` earlier

---

name: setup-git

# Setting up Git

- Run `usethis::use_git()` in the console
- This will initialise your project as a Git repo
- `use_git()` will also automatically ask us if we want to commit our current files
  - Here type the number corresponding for "*I agree*" to commit them all by hitting the enter key
- Next within the console it will ask to restart Rstudio to activate the Git pane
  - Type the number corresponding for "*Yes*" and hit the enter key

---

name: setup-github

# Setting Up GitHub

- Now we will give RStudio the power to create GitHub repositories for us!
- Run `browse_github_token()` in the console
  - This will open your default browser and bring you to the "New personal access token" (PAT) page
  - Scroll to the bottom and click &lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZVvVhOw.png" width="7%"/&gt;
  - Now you have a PAT generated for RStudio, select &lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/GGzWB50.png" width="1.5%"/&gt; to copy it to your clipboard
- Type `edit_r_environ()` to open the `/.Renviron` file
- Create a new line and enter `GITHUB_PAT="PASTE-YOUR-COPIED-PAT-HERE"`
  - Save and reset R (Session &gt; Restart R)
- Run `use_github()` in the console and choose the **https** option and then choose the option corresponding to **Yes** for *Are title and description ok?*
- If everything was done correctly your package is now in your GitHub!
  - Moving forward for other projects using git you can use follow the `use_git()` followed by `use_github()` to create repositories for each project! Nice!
  - Notice that the `Title:` text we typed in the `DESCRIPTION` file is used as our description on our GitHub page
- In a few more slides we will see how we can commit and push changes to our GitHub repo

---

name: document

# Documenting Functions

- When we need help learning more about functions we use we look to its documentation to help us
  - Example: `?mean()`
- This requires that your package have a special R documentation file, `man/is_even.Rd`
- This is written in an R-specific markup language that is sort of like LaTeX
- Following the flow of what we have done, there are functions made to make our life easy for documenting our functions
- Specially formatted comments are written above functions for documentation
  - In this example this will be placed in `R/is_even.R`
- A package called `roxygen2` will handle creating the documentation files in `man/` for us
  - More information about `roxygen2` can be found in chapter 6 [Object documentation][roxygen2]

.pull-left[
- Open `R/is_even.R` and put the cursor somewhere in the `is_even()` function definition
- In the menu bar at the top of the screen go to &lt;br&gt; `Code &gt; Insert Roxygen Skeleton`
- As the command states, this is only the skeleton. We will need to fill in the rest manually as seen in the image below
]
.pull-right[

# Documentation Example

``` r
#' Is this value even?
#' 
#' Reveals if x is even, where x is a numeric value
#'
#' @param x numeric value
#'
#' @return boolean
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
is_even &lt;- function(x) {
  x %% 2 == 0
}
```

- Now we need to tell RStudio to convert our roxygen comments into `man/is_even.R` by running `devtools::document()`
  - Hotkeys: Ctrl + Shift + D (Windows &amp; Linux) or Cmd + Shift + D (macOS)
  
---

# Documentation Example

- This will update `DESCRIPTION` and `NAMESPACE` with the neccessary information to make our function work with the package
  - `DESCRIPTION`: added `RoxygenNote: 6.1.1`
  - `NAMESPACE`: added `export(is_even)`
    - This means we want our package to make our function available to users when they use `library(samplepackage)`
- This has also created a new folder, `man/`
  - This is the folder where our documentation for function will go
  - When users run `?is_even()` this is the file that is brought up
- Whenever you change a function be sure to update the roxygen2 comments
  - You will need to run `devtools::document()` each time!
- Follow this process for every function you create for your package
- This addresses the `Undocumented code objects: ‚Äòis_even‚Äô` warning we received from `check()` earlier
- Lets run `check()` again to see if we fixed the warnings
  - If everything was done correctly we should have checkmarks across the board!
- This is a great time to commit our changes to GitHub

name: commit-and-push

# Commit and Pushing Changes

&lt;center&gt;

  &lt;source src="https://i.imgur.com/9hn3GsO.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

- In the **Environment** pane select the **Git** tab and select **Commit**
1. Select all of the boxes to the left of your files
2. Write a commit message summarizeing your updates
  - The gif above is a simple example
  - It is good to describe all the additions and changes
  - You can also commit each file seperately with its own message
3. Hit the **Commit** button
4. After the commiting is done close the box and select **Push**
  - Check your GitHub repo online to confirm the code has been updated
  
---

name: automate-testing

# Automate Testing of Functions

- Earlier we informaly tested `is_even()` with `load_all()`, as we create more functions and make them more robust we will look to unit tests to simplify this process
- What does this mean? We will declare what we expect our function to do, this will ensure our functions acting accordingly
- To declare we want to use these testing methods with our package we will run `use_testthat()`
- Three things happened with this function call
  1. Added the `testthat` library to *Suggests* in the `DESCRIPTION`
    - More on this soon!
  2. Created a directory `tests/testthat/`
  3. Adds the script `test/testthat.R`
- Now we need to write the test(s) for our `is_even()` function
  - Two ways to begin this process:
    1. In RStudio have `is_even.R` open so you can see the function and run `use_test()`
    2. Or run `use_test("is_even")
  - This will create `tests/testthat/test-is_even.R`, our script for creating tests
  

---

# Writing Tests for *is_even.R*

- Put this in the created `test-is_even.R` script:

``` r
test_that("this will return TRUE", {
  expect_true(is_even(10))
})

test_that("this will return FALSE", {
  expect_false(is_even(11))
})
```

- Due to the simplicity of our function we only need a few simple tests
  - First parameter of `test_that()` is `desc`, the name of the test
  - Next we put the code for testing
  - There are many different `expect_*` functions that make testing easy
  - For each parameter there should be a test to make sure we are covering every possilbity of our functions
     - This will align with **Code Coverage** testing that we will go over soon
    
---

# Running the Tests

- It is encouraged to run these tests locally to make sure they are not returning errors
  - Make sure you have ran `library(testthat)` or `load_all()` to test the function
  - Try to purposely make `is_even()` fail so you are familiar with the output of testing
    - Be sure to change the test back to the correct method if you do this!
- Run `test()` to run all tests that have been made for the package
  - Hotkeys: Ctrl + Shift + T (Windows &amp; Linux) or Cmd + Shift + T (macOS)
  - For `is_even()`, you should get `OK: 2`, one for each one of the tests we made
- Now would be a good tie to go through and practice the developing flow
  1. document()
  2. check()
  3. test()
  4. Commit and push
  
---

name: importing-functions

# Importing Other Functions

- When we write our functions we may use another libraries functions
  - Such as the pipe, `%&gt;%`, from magrittr
- We needed `NAMESPACE` to **export** is_even(), we will need to **import** other packages and functions from their namespace
- Run `use_package("magrittr")` to enable access to the pipe, `%&gt;%`
  - This wiill add `magrittr` to the `DESCRIPTION` file
- Lets add a second function to the package to demonstrate the structore of a function that uses other packages, `use_r("evens_only")`
- There are multiple methods for correctly importing functions
  - If you are only using one function from a function use `library::function`
    - This will make easier to keep track of other functions
  - Adding `#' @importFrom  magrittr, %&gt;%` to the roxygen comments is also an option
  - If you are using multiple functions from a package use `#' @import library` in the roxygen comments
  
---

# **evens_only()**

``` r
#' Return Evens
#'
#' Given a vector of numbers, this will allow the user to see the even numbers only
#'
#' @import magrittr
#' @param x vector of numeric values
#'
#' @return even values
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
evens_only &lt;- function(x) {
  x[x %&gt;% is_even()]
}
```

- I strongly recommend to read more on importing other functions if this is an area you come across
  - Chapter 9 [Namespace][r-pkg-namespace]
- Make sure you run `document()` to create new documentation for the function
  - Or if you are curious, run `check()` to see the error
  - Getting familiar with errors is a great learning experience
  
---

name: readme

# Create a README

- We now have a package on GitHub, it would be nice to explain our package in depth with code examples
- This is where the README comes in
  - For a simple example check out my readme for my package I am using to learn [here][koderkow]
- Run `use_readme_rmd()`
  - This will create a README.Rmd file
  - Adds lines to `.Rbuildignore` so package building won't throw a warning
    - The README.Rmd will throw an warning if it is not ignored due to it being an exepcted file type in the main directory
  - Adds a hook to the .md and .Rmd to ensure they are always up to date with one another
    - This will remind you if you forgot to knit the .Rmd
- There are helpful sections included in this skeleton
  - Describe the purpose of the package
  - Code to install your package
    - The default is to install from CRAN, I suggest switching this to `devtools::install_github("YOUR-USE-NAME/REPO-NAME")`
  - A section to show a bit of usage
- These can be populated with our previous work done
  - Copy and paste information from the `DESCRIPTION` file
  - Show code examples from start to finish, reproducibility is important!
- Knit the .RMD and verify the README looks as expected

---

# What's Next?

- If everything is set to go, commit and push
- You now have your own package with documentation on GitHub!
- The next sections will go over setting up automatic build testing for our package, we will start with **Travis CI**

---

# Travis CI

- If you are familiar with packages on GitHub this may look familiar: &lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/jrOk8iP.png" width="9%"/&gt;
- `build: passing`, what does this mean?
  - Rewind to the output of `check()`, if there is 1 warning, error, or note this will show as `build: fail:`
  - This shows users if there are any of these issues in the current version on GitHub
  - Travis CI (Continuous Integration) is essentially doing a `check()` for us every commit and making sure it can be successfully installed on others machines
    - If your package is open source and not private then Travis CI will be free for you
  
---

name: travis-ci

# Setting up Travis CI

- Head to their website [travis-ci.org][travis-ci]
- Hit the "Sign In with GitHub" button
- Authorize and give permissions that Travis CI is asking for
- You may land on a page with "GitHub Apps Integration" on it
  - Hit the "Activate" button
- You may also be taken to GitHub to approve Travis CI with your repos
  - Make sure "All repositories" is selected and hit "Approve &amp; Install" at the bottom
- In the RStudio console run `use_travis()` and your browser will open to the Travis CI site
  - This creates the needed `travis.yml` for you with the specific code needed to make sure Travis runs correctly
  - This function call also adds the `build: pass/fail` badge to our README.Rmd for us
- Here "switch on" the name of your package/repo to enable build testing
.center[&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/4pBClQ7.png" width="70%"/&gt;]
- Go back to RStudio and knit the .Rmd then commit/push the related README files and `travis.yml`
- With this commit, it will trigger the first build on Travis CI!

---

# Travis CI Notes

- You can follow along with Travis CIif you want to see what goes on during the process by click on your repo while it says it is building
- This log will always be available no matter what status the build ends with
- If the build passes or fails this will automatically update your badge on GitHub
  - Head to your repo and check out the README!
- If the build fails check out the log and inspect where it failed
  - Make sure `check()` returns no wanrings, errors, or notes! These will trigger Travis CI to fail
  - Make sure to use `devtools` and `usethis` to create files for the packages, it will automatically write and update files that need to be ignored for us

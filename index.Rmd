# Presentation Goal

The goal of this presentation is to bring together multiple sources of amazing information and tutorials to show how easy it is to not only create a package, but to integrate automated building, testing, and webpages by utilizing pre-built R packages. I hope this inspires others to create and contribute to packages that are used daily in R.

## Goals

- General understanding of packages
- Follow methods from Hadley's [*R Packages*][r-pkg-book] book for setting up your envinroment and package creating methods
- Hosting on github
- Automate build testing
- Code coverage
- Generate a package webpage with `pkgdown`
  - Automate `pkgdown` site with **Travis CI**

---

name: prerequisites

# Prerequisites

- Install these packages:
``` r
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr"))
# get the development versions from github
devtools::install_github("r-lib/devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-lib/usethis")
```
- C compiler
  - Check if you have by running this in your console:
``` r
devtools::has_devel()
```
  - If `FALSE` is returned, follow section 1.3 in Hadley's book [*R Packages*][r-pkg-getting-started] for assistance in getting everything set up
  
- To host the package you will need Git and GitHub setup with RStudio
  - Follow Chapter 14.2 "Initial set up" of [*R Packages*][git-setup] if you do not have this already

# What is a Package?

name: create-package

# Creating a Package With **usethis**

``` r
library(usethis)
create_package("~/path/to/directory")
```

.pull-left[
- Choose a file path you want your package to be saved
  - `create_package("~/desktop/samplepackage")` where `samplepackage` is the name of your package
  - The package name should be lowercase and have no spaces, underderscores, or hyphens
- Run the code in the RStudio console
- `create_package` will:
  - Create the directory
  - Create the basic file structure
  - Creates .Rproj file for project work flows
  - Switch your RStudio to the project made for your package
- `.gitignore`: anticipates Git usage and ignores some standard, behind-the-scenes files created by R and RStudio
]

.pull-right[
- `.Rbuildignore`:  lists files that we need to have around but that should not be included when building the R package from source
- `.Rproj.user`: if you have it, is a directory used internally by RStudio
- `DESCRIPTION`: provides [metadata about your package][r-pkg-metadata]
- [`NAMESPACE`][r-pkg-namespace]: declares the functions your package exports for external use and the external functions your package imports from other packages. At the moment, it holds temporary-yet-functional placeholder content
- `R/`: directory is the [“business end” of your package][r-pkg-r]. It will soon contain .R files with function definitions.
- `YOURPACKAGE.Rproj`: is the file that makes this directory an RStudio Project
]

name: first-function

# First Function

- For this example we will make a simple `is_even()` function for demonstration purposes
- If you have created a package before you may be acustomed to creating a new script, writing the code, and then saving it inside the `R/` directory
- With the package `usethis` we can follow a smoother flow
- Type `use_r("is_even")` into the console
  - This will Create a .R file called `is_even.R` for us inside the `R/` directory
  - `use_r()` Takes care of naming and saving the script into the correct directory for us!
- We will define our function in the .R script that has been made:
```{r}
is_even <- function(x) {
  x %% 2 == 0
}
```

---

name: test-functions

# Testing Functions Within a Package

- How can we efficiently test our functions for our package?
- Avoid running the function locally, instead we can use `load_all()` to experiment with our new function
  - This will automatically save your .R files if they have not been saved previously, this ensures you are locally testing what you have coded
- Note that `load_all()` has made the `is_even()` function available, although it does not exist in the global workspace
- `load_all()` simulates the process of building, installing, and attaching the foofactors package; this is much faster than building, installing, and attaching the package
- Now we can type `is_even(10)` into our console to test our package
  - We can see our function is from our new package! 🥳

name: check-it

# *check()* it!

- Now that we know our `is_even()` function is working as expected, how can we check if our package as a whole will work?
- `check()` is the gold standard for checking that an R package is in full working order
- Make a habit to run `check()` after each change to *check* if your package is producing any warnings, errors, or notes
- `check()` will produce a lot of out put, generally the part of the output we are interested in will be the ending that displays:

``` r
0 errors ✔ | 2 warnings ✖ | 0 notes ✔
```

- If you have been following along your package will have these warnings
- Whenever there is an error, warning, or note, the output above this text will show you why these statuses were generated
  - `Non-standard license specification: What license it uses`
  - `Undocumented code objects: ‘is_even’`
- These two warnings will be addressed soon
- We have made a lot of progress, next we will edit the `DESCRIPTION` file and push our progress to GitHub

---

name: description

# Editing the **DESCRIPTION** File

- The `DESCRIPTION` file provides metadata about your package
  - For more information look at chapter 5 [metadata about your package][r-pkg-metadata]
- In the `DESCRIPTION` file edit these:
  - Make yourself the author
  - Write some descriptive text in the `Title` and `Description` fields
```{r description-fodder, asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA, eval = create}
DESCRIPTION_fodder <- c(
  'Package: samplepackage',
  'Title: Is That Number Even?',
  'Version: 0.0.0.9000',
  'Authors@R:',
  '    person(given = "Kyle",',
  '           family = "Harris",',
  '           role = c("aut", "cre"),',
  '           email = "koderkow@gmail.com")',
  'Description: There are a few times in ones programming life where one',
  '    needs to find out if a number is truly even. This package unlocks',
  '    the puzzling matter that is even numbers.',
  'License: What license it uses',
  'Encoding: UTF-8',
  'LazyData: true'
)
writeLines(DESCRIPTION_fodder, "DESCRIPTION")
cat(DESCRIPTION_fodder, sep = "\n")
```

name: license

# Adding a License

- Hadley provides a fantastic link that summarizes the different kinds of software licenses: [Pick a License, Any License][pick-a-license]
- We will set up a MIT license
  - Simple and permissive license
  - Includes generic legal disclaimer of liability
  - `DESCRIPTION` requires: `License: MIT + file LICENSE`
    - The `+ file LICENSE` also requires an additonal file, `LICENSE`
    - This file generally has `YEAR:` and `COPYRIGHT HOLDER:` fields
- Lucky for us, `usethis` has a function that will set this up for us
- Run `use_mit_license("FIRST-NAME LAST-NAME")` in the console
- This will create the files for MIT and update your `DESCRIPTION` file for you
- `usethis` will print out to the consoles what it is adding and/or changing to files in your package directory

---

name: setup-git

# Setting up Git

- Run `use_git()` in the console
- This will initialise your project as a Git repo
- `use_git()` will also automatically ask us if we want to commit our current files
  - Here type the number corresponding for "*I agree*" to commit them all by hitting the enter key
- Next within the console it will ask to restart Rstudio to activate the Git pane
  - Type the number corresponding for "*Yes*" and hit the enter key

---

name: setup-github

# Setting Up GitHub

- Now we will give RStudio the power to create GitHub repositories for us!
- Run `browse_github_token()` in the console
  - This will open your default browser and bring you to the "New personal access token" (PAT) page
  - Scroll to the bottom and click <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZVvVhOw.png" width="7%"/>
  - Now you have a PAT generated for RStudio, select <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GGzWB50.png" width="1.5%"/> to copy it to your clipboard
- Type `edit_r_environ()` to open the `/.Renviron` file
- Create a new line and enter `GITHUB_PAT="PASTE-YOUR-COPIED-PAT-HERE"`
  - Save and reset R (Session > Restart R)
- Run `use_github()` in the console and choose the **https** option and then choose the option corresponding to **Yes** for *Are title and description ok?*
- If everything was done correctly your package is now in your GitHub!
  - Moving forward for other projects using git you can use follow the `use_git()` followed by `use_github()` to create repositories for each project! Nice!
  - Notice that the description we typed in the `DESCRIPTION` file is used as our description on our GitHub page
- In a few more slides we will see how we can commit and push changes to our GitHub repo

name: document

# Documenting Functions

- When we need help learning more about functions we use we look to its documentation to help us
  - Example: `?mean()`
- This requires that your package have a special R documentation file, `man/is_even.Rd`
- This is written in an R-specific markup language that is sort of like LaTeX
- Following the flow of what we have done, there are functions made to make our life easy for documenting our functions
- Specially formatted comments are written above functions for documentation
  - In this example this will be placed in `R/is_even.R`
- A package called `roxygen2` will handle creating the documentation files in `man/` for us
  - More information about `roxygen2` can be found in chapter 6 [Object documentation][roxygen2]

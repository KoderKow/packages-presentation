# Presentation Goal

I made this presentation to help bring together multiple sources of amazing information and tutorials to show how easy it is to not only create a package, but to integrate automated building, testing, and webpages by utilizing pre-built R packages. My goal is to help inspire others to create and contribute to packages that are used daily in R.

## Goals

- General understanding of packages
- Follow methods from Hadley's [*R Packages*][r-pkg-book] book for setting up your envinroment and package creating methods
- Hosting on github
- Automate build testing
- Code coverage
- Generate a package webpage with `pkgdown`
  - Automate `pkgdown` site with **Travis CI**

---

name: prerequisites

# Prerequisites

- Have these packages installed:
``` r
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr"))
# get the development versions from github
devtools::install_github("r-lib/devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-lib/usethis")
```
- C compiler
  - Check if you have by running this in your console:
``` r
devtools::has_devel()
```
  - If `FALSE` is returned, follow section 1.3 in Hadley's book [*R Packages*][r-pkg-getting-started] for assistance in getting everything set up
  
- To host the package you will need Git and GitHub setup with RStudio
  - Follow Chapter 14.2 "Initial set up" of [*R Packages*][git-setup] if you do not have this already

# What is a Package?

name: create-package

# Creating a Package With **usethis**

``` r
library(usethis)
create_package("~/path/to/directory")
```

.pull-left[
- Choose a file path you want your package to be saved
  - `create_package("~/desktop/samplepackage")` where `samplepackage` is the name of your package
  - The package name should be lowercase and have no spaces, underderscores, or hyphens
- Run the code in the RStudio console
- `create_package` will:
  - Create the directory
  - Create the basic file structure
  - Creates .Rproj file for project work flows
  - Switch your RStudio to the project made for your package
- `.gitignore`: anticipates Git usage and ignores some standard, behind-the-scenes files created by R and RStudio
]

.pull-right[
- `.Rbuildignore`:  lists files that we need to have around but that should not be included when building the R package from source
- `.Rproj.user`: if you have it, is a directory used internally by RStudio
- `DESCRIPTION`: provides [metadata about your package][r-pkg-metadata]
- [`NAMESPACE`][r-pkg-namespace]: declares the functions your package exports for external use and the external functions your package imports from other packages. At the moment, it holds temporary-yet-functional placeholder content
- `R/`: directory is the [‚Äúbusiness end‚Äù of your package][r-pkg-r]. It will soon contain .R files with function definitions.
- `YOURPACKAGE.Rproj`: is the file that makes this directory an RStudio Project
]

name: setup-git

# Setting up Git

- Run `use_git()` in the console
- This will initialise your project as a Git repo
- `use_git()` will also automatically ask us if we want to commit our current files
  - Here type the number corresponding for "*I agree*" to commit them all by hitting the enter key
- Next within the console it will ask to restart Rstudio to activate the Git pane
  - Type the number corresponding for "*Yes*" and hit the enter key

---

name: setup-github

# Setting Up GitHub

- Now we will give RStudio the power to create GitHub repositories for us!
- Run `browse_github_token()` in the console
  - This will open your default browser and bring you to the "New personal access token" (PAT) page
  - Scroll to the bottom and click <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZVvVhOw.png" width="7%"/>
  - Now you have a PAT generated for RStudio, select <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GGzWB50.png" width="1.5%"/> to copy it to your clipboard
- Type `edit_r_environ()` to open the `/.Renviron` file
- Create a new line and enter `GITHUB_PAT="PASTE-YOUR-COPIED-PAT-HERE"`
  - Save and reset R (Session > Restart R)
- Run `use_github()` in the console and choose the **https** option and then choose the option corresponding to **Yes** for *Are title and description ok?*
- If everything was done correctly your package is now in your GitHub!
  - Moving forward for other projects using git you can use follow the `use_git()` followed by `use_github()` to create repositories for each project! Nice!

name: first-function

# First Function

- For this example we will make a simple `is_even()` function for demonstration purposes
- Type `use_r("is_even")` into the console
  - Creates a .R file called `is_even.R` for us inside the `R/` directory
  - This is where all of our functions will live

```{r}
is_even <- function(x) {
  x %% 2 == 0
}
```

- How can we efficiently test our functions for our package?
- Avoid running the function locally, instead we can use `load_all()` to experiment with our new function
- Note that `load_all()` has made the `is_even()` function available, although it does not exist in the global workspace
- `load_all()` simulates the process of building, installing, and attaching the foofactors package; this is much faster than building, installing, and attaching the package
- Now we can type `is_even(10)` into our console to test our package
  - We can see our function is from our new package! ü•≥
